Azure uses range partition for storing blobs

In a range partition, files that are in a lexical sequence end up together in a partition.

Azure storage uses account name + container name + blob name as partition key

ADLF gen2 for folder structure

Horizontal partitioning - subset of rows called shards(select key for even distribution)
Vertical (table with fewer columns)
functional partitioning


synapse analytics - dedicated pools and spark sql 

A dedicated SQL pool is a massively parallel processing (MPP) system that splits the queries into 60 parallel queries and executes them in parallel. Each of these smaller queries runs on something called a distribution. A distribution is a basic unit of processing and storage for a dedicated SQL pool. There are three different ways to distribute (shard) data among distributions, as listed here:
Dedicated SQL pool also supports three types of tables: clustered columnstore, clustered index, and heap tables.

ingress rate  - in rate
egress rate - out 

SCD1- overwrite
SCD2 - flag
SCD3 - preserve the value 
SCD4 - split 
SCD6 - SCD1,SCD2,SCD3

Temporal data - 
    tables keep track of changes over time (with system versioning = on)

    Pipeline - activity - dataset - linkedservice and triggers

Incremental load 
    - Using watermarks db table
    - file to_timestamp
    - partition based on time

Copy data tool - use tumbling windows to trigger time bases loads
