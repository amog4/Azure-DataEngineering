3 important file format in azure and aws

Avro - row based storage format
        Need to query entire file (good for writes)
        ex - 11,am,w,12,sm,e

Parquet - column based storage format 
        ex- 11,12,am,sm,w,e

ORC - similar to parquet mostly used for hive

How to choose

if there are lot of etl jobs then choose avro 

For transformation zone use parquet (or) orc
