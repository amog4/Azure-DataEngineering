Azure Sql , synapse serverless/dedicated pools (sql warehouse)
Spark and hive

storage layer
    partitioning data and replicating the data also reduce cross partition operations  
    pruning - keep data that is useful 
    eventual consistancy (eventually data would be updated)

Application layer
    data caching - cpu (central processing units)
    application turning tuning (such as varying the sizes of containers, increasing parallelism)
        VMs size
    spark - num of executors
            executor memory
            cores
    resultset in synapse for caching
Query layer
    Indexing (hashmap) and views (logical projection of data)


Optimize for faster and evenly distributed reads
    Azure has subscription limits on size of data, network and ingest

Streaming data folder structure is important 
    {Region}/Sensitive/{subject matter}/{yyyy}/{MM}

synapse dedicated sql pools
    MPP (splits the queries into 60 parallel queries) each of this run on distribution (unit of processing and storage for dedicated pool)

    storage -uses azure storage and distributed hash tables, replicated tables and round robin tables

    round robin (default distribution) is similar to even distribution in redshift 
    hash tables - in redshift its key distribution (with distribution = hash)
    replicated tables (with distribution = replicated) - all distribution in redshift
